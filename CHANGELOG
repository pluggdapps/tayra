h3. 0.1dev

Initial version of tayra.  A non-exhaustive list of features and functions
available from tayra.

* ''expression substitution'', substitute dynamic content anywhere in your
  document using python expression.
* ''escaping text'', while substituting text, it can be escaped with one or
  more filters. While escape-filters themselves can be added as plugins to tayra.
* ''filter blocks'', process non-template text and substitute the filter block
  with processed text (optional). One such example can be a block of python code
  that need to do some ''view'' related processing. And ofcourse one can 
  create any many types of filter-blocks (plugins !!)
* ''control blocks'', make use of control blocks like ''if-elif-else'', to
  conditionally select portions of templates. And ''for/while'' loop to repeate
  blocks of template text.
* ''functions'', abstract re-usable blocks of templates into functions with its
  own local scope and local-context.
* ''import templates'', import templates from other parts of the source tree
  into the current template's namespace and access their function blocks.
* ''inheritance'', there is a simple yet powerful idea of inheritance, whereby
  templates can have a long chain of inheritance from the base layout. A
  template module in the chain can access any other inheriting or inherited
  templates using the ''parent'' and ''next'' namespace, while ''self''
  namespace provides you the magic of overriding.
* ''how to use'', Can be used via its well-defined API or from command line.
