1. Check paper.js (Javascript+canvas) and see how one can write plugins in
   tayra using that.

Feature requests :

* filters for expression evaluation,
    html-entity-escaping

* Enable file check, using `reload_templates` ttlconfig, so that the
  intermediate template files and in memory code cache will be regenerated
  when ever the file is updated.

* Whitespace pruning,
    before and after opening tag and closing tag (for outerprune)

* @use directive should include ${...} expression evaluation syntax.

* Micro-templating similar to mako. This will demonstrate the true power of
  StackMachine based design.

* Custom tag plugin for form generation.

* Standard tag for SVG.
