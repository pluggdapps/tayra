* Bug fix. Parser should pass for empty ttl files. files containing just
  directives or tags.

* Bug fix. The following line creates problem.
    <td.brace1 rowspan="3" {font-size : xx-large;} > {

* Bug fix. The following expression fails, that is when using dictionary.
  ${ conf.render( {}, config ) }
  Once fixed, change template code in config.ttl of etsite, couchpysite, tyrsite.

* charset directive should be read and based on the character-set encoding
  the whole text must be re-read. This character set encoding specified in TTL
  text must override the encoding config-param passed by the caller program.
  Intermediate python file should also adhere to this encoding.

* What is BOM in syntax grammar ? Should this part of string encoding or lexer ?
    BOM (EF, BB, BF) syntax is not allowed in utf-8 encoding, so where ever
        codecs.open(...).read() is used stip them off.

* Looks like ':' prefix is used for XML namespace. This is in direct conflict
  with tag name specifier ':', so change it to '::' specifier syntax and translate
  as is, ':' specifier prefix XML namespace.

* Once stripping is made available (or inline tags), 
    http://localhost:5000/bootstrap/config 
  config value must not introduce whitespace.

* Check paper.js (Javascript+canvas) and see how one can write plugins in
  tayra using that.

* Propose a mail to various community list explaining the exiting future
  and oppurtunities in HTML5, SVG (and associated standards) and how Tayra
  can play an important role in that.

* Document the scope of escape (\) character.

* Document the special characters that are not allowed in tag-specifiers.

* Document the special characters that are not allowed in content.

* parser.restart() and lex.restart() does not seem to be sufficient, for now
  avoiding reuse of parser and lexer objects. Find a long term solution.

* Remove ITestInterface and replace it with a valid plugin.

* Test cases / profiling / code-coverage.

Errors and warnings :

* Flag error if @function is used in-place of @interface, and vice-versa.

* Flag error if an interfaced is being declared as implemented but 
  some of the methods are not implemented using @interface.

* ITTLPlugin under tayra/plugins.py is to be removed.

* Flag errors when circular inheritance or circular import/include are detected.

* Make tutorial.etx and getStarted.etx and updated reference.etx first paragraph.

* SVG support, Kendo-UI and Component Art.

* Context-based compilation, context-less compilation.

* Code generation optimization.

* Global statements in ttl file should not by body local. They *must* be global.

* How are context functions (from helper file imported) into template context ?
