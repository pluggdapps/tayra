    Let us experiment with different ways of using attributes.
    Note that attributes always follow `specifiers` and `styles`
    <div title="hello world"> attribute value is provided as a string.
    <div disabled="disabled"> attribute value is provided as an atom.
    <div #specid .floatr.fgblue dummy spec disabled>
      attribute value is provided as an atom, along with specifiers
    <a> fine clause
      
    <div #spcid .floatr.fgblue dummy {background-color : crimson;}
         disabled>
      attribute value is provided as an atom, along with specifiers and styling
    <a> hello world
