Let us experiment with different ways of using attributes.
Note that attributes always follow `specifiers` and `styles`
<div   title="hello world"> attribute value is provided as a string.</div>
<div   disabled=disabled> attribute value is provided as an atom.</div>
<div  id="specid" class="floatr fgblue"  disabled=disabled>
attribute value is provided as an atom, along with specifiers
</div><div  id="specid" class="floatr fgblue"  style="background-color : crimson;" disabled=disabled>
attribute value is provided as an atom, along with specifiers and styling
</div></body></html>
