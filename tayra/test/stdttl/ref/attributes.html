    Let us experiment with different ways of using attributes.
    Note that attributes always follow `specifiers` and `styles`
    <div  title="hello world"> attribute value is provided as a string.</div>
    <div  disabled="disabled"> attribute value is provided as an atom.</div>
    <div  id="specid" class="floatr fgblue" disabled="disabled">
      attribute value is provided as an atom, along with specifiers</div>
    <a > fine clause
      
    </a><div  id="spcid" class="floatr fgblue" disabled="disabled" style="background-color : crimson;">
      attribute value is provided as an atom, along with specifiers and styling</div>
    <a > hello world
      
</a></body></html>
