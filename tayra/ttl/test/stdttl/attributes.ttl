    Let us experiment with different ways of using attributes.
    Note that attributes always follow `specifiers` and `styles`
    <div title="hello world"!> attribute value is provided as a string.
    <div disabled=disabled> attribute value is provided as an atom.
    <div#specid.floatr.fgblue dummy spec disabled=disabled>
      attribute value is provided as an atom, along with specifiers
    <div#specid.floatr.fgblue dummy spec {background-color : crimson;}
    disabled=disabled>
      attribute value is provided as an atom, along with specifiers and styling
